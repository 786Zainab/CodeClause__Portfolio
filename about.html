          I believe my strength is my attitude to take up challenges without
          thinking whether I will succeed or fail. I always try to move forward
          in a balanced manner. My motivation is my parents who always complete
          every task with a smile.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          Currently, I am in search of a platform that allows me to expand my
          career and grow with the organisation's success. My focus is always on
          taking up new challenges and putting in all my efforts and knowledge
          to cope with them efficiently.
        </p>
